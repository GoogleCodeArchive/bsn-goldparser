# Introduction #

This library is a .NET engine to load compiled grammar files generated by [Devin Cook's GOLD Parser Builder](http://www.goldparser.org/) and use them to parse text in your applications.

This engine is only one of many available for .NET, some of which can be found on the GOLD Parser home page. However, the main feature of this engine which makes it different from the existing ones is the ability to map semantic action classes to terminals or reduction rules, so that a completely functional semantic AST can be created directly without intermediate token AST representation, and without the need for glue code.

**Note:** The current version (2.0) supports both CGT and the new EGT file format (auto-detected based on file contents). When updating projects that use the library you might get some "Obsolete" warnings on compilation for the functionality that changed in relation to EGT files, and it is suggested to update the files to the EGT format and replace the obsolete enum values with the correct new ones. Please read the [migration wiki page](CGTtoEGT.md) for more info.

**Have a look at the SampleCalculator tutorial to see how easy it is to use!**
